###  Project Outline
The following project presents a pathfinding algorithms visualizer on which you can view the 
methodology of the most well-known pathfinding algorithms. 
The project currently presents 3 different algorithms: 
* <ins>BFS (Breadth-first search)</ins> - is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level, BFS **guarantees the shortest path**
* <ins>DFS (Depth-first search)</ins> - is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, therfore DFS **does not guarantees the shortest path** 
* <ins>Bidirectional BFS</ins> - a BFS based algorithms which preforms the search both from the source and destionation nodes, until a common node is reached, Bidirectional BFS **guarantees the shortest path**
